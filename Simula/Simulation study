A simulation study is presented to show the potential of our proposal. We simulate
data sets from a model with a monotone constraint on a covariate such that its smoothing
function is monotone increasing. We consider different scenarios to show the advantages of 
our proposal in an empirical manner, since analytical proofs to validate can be a difficult
task. We analyse the data sets with GAMMs with and without the constraint. In addition, we
include GLMMs in the analysis with and without monotone constraints. The 4 models are
compared through a method based on the expected log pointwise predictive density (elpd),
by using LOO and WAIC through the R packages loo (?) and Stan (??), and the mean
absolute error (MAE).
